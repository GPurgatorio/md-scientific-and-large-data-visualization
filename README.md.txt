# Scientific and Large Data Visualization

The *SLDV Notes.pdf* here contains a resume made from the slides. In the last page, there are some questions from my/another oral exam.

The rest of the files are the original project. 
The project was about data visualization, where I had to show some infographics on women's refuges in Italy (Case Rifugio, Centri Antiviolenza). An explaination a bit more in-depth is on the site itself (on the info button). The site isn't meant to be visited from a mobile screen because it works around the "mouse hover" event, so just use a desktop/notebook please.
Furthermore, some parts of the code are intentionally bad (I kinda dislike the HTML + CSS + Javascript combo), and since the code wasn't going to be reviewed I had a bit of fun here and there (have you ever seen a Selection Sort that also uses additional space?)

Still, it's all hosted on the Github Pages as usual: https://gpurgatorio.github.io/md-scientific-and-large-data-visualization/
