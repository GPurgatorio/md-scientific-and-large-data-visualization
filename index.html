                This is a project made by Giulio Purgatorio for the course's exam of "Scientific and Large Data Visualization", Master Degree in Computer Science, Pisa (2020-2021).<br/><br/>
                <p align=center><b>Aim of the project</b><br/></p>
                The project aimed to see how much of granted funds were liquidated in Italy during the period 2016-2018, region by region. <br/>
                Most of the used data comes from ActionAid directly and can be found in the Dataset link in the navigation bar: shown data is updated up to October 2020. <br/><br/>
                <p align=center><b>About the project:</b><br/></p>
                Many values were compared (e.g. the ratio between the two fund types, the behavior with respect to the previous year, etc.). <br/>
                Hovering on a region highlights many pieces of information: the granted funds that were given for a specific reason like creating new refugees, or maintaining existing ones,
                or expenses made for extra activities (e.g. school sensitization, etc.). <br/>
                Moreover, a sunburst chart shows in a visual manner the actual liquidated funds and specifically when they were sent, for what reason, helping 
                visualizing how much is missing from the total granted. <br/>
                Finally, a stacked bar chart is visible to show off how the region was doing in 2017 and 2018 respectively, while the hovered region 
                is highlighted to see if it's going better or worse than the previous year.<br/>
